# TestPopups

## Start the application

Run `pnpx nx serve web` to start the development server. Happy coding!

## Build for production

Run `pnpx nx run web:build` to build the application. The build artifacts are stored in the output directory (`dist/apps/web`), ready to be deployed.

## Set up CI!

Nx comes with local caching already built-in (check your `nx.json`). On CI you might want to go a step further.

- [Set up remote caching](https://nx.dev/features/share-your-cache)
- [Set up task distribution across multiple machines](https://nx.dev/nx-cloud/features/distribute-task-execution)
- [Learn more how to setup CI](https://nx.dev/recipes/ci)

## Explore the project graph

Run `pnpx nx graph` to show the graph of the workspace.
It will show tasks that you can run with Nx.
